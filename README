Here are keymaps that I use to facilitate working with Dvorak. I'm focusing on OSX,
where I use Dvorak-Qwerty on my work computer.

For now, I'm including my IntelliJ and Eclipse keymaps. I'm also posting my AutoHotKey
script that remaps some (but not all) CTRL shortcuts on Windows. I'd like to improve my
AHK script as I conform more and more to Dvorak-Qwerty.
